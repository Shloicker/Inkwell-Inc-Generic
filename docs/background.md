## Background

 Text adventures were likely the first type of computer game to be created and it is their simplicity that allows for such freedom in creating an immersive world. However, to a novice programmer, the prospect of creating a text adventure from scratch is a daunting prospect. While doing this is a great way to learn code, if you want create a simple text adventure quickly and easily, this library is an ideal tool. A basic knowledge of objects helps to understand what you are doing but it's not really necessary - just follow the syntax as outlined in the tutorial and you can easily create your own items, enemies and map. If you are more knowledgeable of programming and want to add more complexity to your game, such as player skills and more subclasses of items, perhaps, then you should be able to expand on the source code relatively easily. This project drew much inspiration from Phillip Johnson's online text adventure tutorial - https://github.com/phillipjohnson/text-adventure-tut.
